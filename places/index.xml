      <description>At the weekend we decided to go somewhere with the child and decided to go to the village Dukora, which is not far from Minsk.
This is one of several famous estates in the vicinity of Minsk. At the entrance, there is a restored gateway, inside which there are a cash register and a souvenir shop.</description>

The trip was purely working, I prepared a report along the way, mounted a podcast, and did other routine things, so there wasnâ€™t much time around to look.</description>
